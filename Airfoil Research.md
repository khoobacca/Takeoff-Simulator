## High Level Drone Layout
- pick + find different vtol layouts
- where does payload go?
- what has best flight characteristics
    ex: - battery is a bit ahead of cg

# Center Grav
- cg payload under cg aircraft

# Summary Datum Moments

# Center Pressure

# Center of Pressure

# Moment of Inertia
Basically how hard it is to turn an object. For our drone, try and keep wings under 2.4

# Aerodynamic efficiency

# Chord Length

# Estimation of Mass Points

## Airfoil Testing
using XFLR to take a look at different attributes...

heres a DB I found for a bunch of different airfoils
https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html

Im looking to analyze for coefficient lift, find an optimal AoA, and consider a constant Reynolds #, (bc of air flow)

- note that coefficient of drag of the wing is not necessarily equal to the coefficient drag of the fuse.

I need to look for/analyze the following properties + gather this information:
1. cL vs AoA
2. Convergence + Stalling
3. Optimal AoA
4. cL vs cD
5. Compare @ diff Re (air speeds 14m/s -> 16m/s)s
