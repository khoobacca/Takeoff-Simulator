# UAS Application Challenge #2
 Takeoff Simulator

## Thoughts:

tbh I did a majority of the application last year when I applied, so I submitted that for the 24 hour window, and I want to take on this new challenge just to see what I can do. For now, I'll put my research here along with my thought process. Here goes nothing:

# Research

okay...

imma break thie problem into a couple steps. when i do research i normally break it up into a couple phases.
1.  concept introduction + basic notes

another note is that when im researching and learning concepts, I look for applications immediately, and i also keep the learning at a very 'general' level. i mean i dont fixate on tiny details because I found that throws me off. If i see the bigger picture then Im able to break the problem down into more manageble chunks.
